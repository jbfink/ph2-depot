# Linux Instructions

These instructions have been tested for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but should work for any apt based system such as Debian or Linux Mint, provided you have sudo installed.

## Install Python 2.7 and the Python Beautiful Soup module.

* Open a terminal (_Dash Home_, then type _Terminal_, then click on the **Terminal** icon.

* Now type:
	
		sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-beautifulsoup

* Enter your password, and then type **Y** to finish the install. Note that you probably have Python 2.7 installed already, so don't be alarmed if Ubuntu tells you that.

## Create a directory where you will put your Python programs. 

* It can be anywhere you like, but it's probably best to put it in your home folder. Something like this in your open terminal window should do the trick:

	
		cd ~
		mkdir ph2-code

## Install Komodo Edit
* Komodo Edit's a free and open source code editor that you can find at the [Komodo Edit website](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit). Once you've downloaded it, open it with Ubuntu's package manager, extract it to your home directory, and follow the installation instructions.

* After installation, you will probably find Komodo Edit in your home directory at Komodo-Edit-7/bin/komodo. Open the home folder, go to the Komodo-Edit-7/bin directory, and click on **komodo**. You can also right click on the Komodo icon in your launcher and click _Lock to Launcher_ to have Komodo saved permanently in your launcher bar.
