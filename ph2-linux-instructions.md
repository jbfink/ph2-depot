# Linux Instructions

These instructions have been tested for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but should work for any apt based system such as Debian or Linux Mint, provided you have sudo installed.

1. Install Python 2.7 and the Python Beautiful Soup module.

Open a terminal (_Dash Home_, then type _Terminal_, then click on the **Terminal** icon.

Now type:
	
	sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-beautifulsoup

And type **Y** to finish the install. Note that you probably have Python 2.7 installed already, so don't be alarmed if Ubuntu tells you that.
