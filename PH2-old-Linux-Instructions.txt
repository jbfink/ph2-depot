Linux Instructions



Thanks to Karin Dalziel for providing the basis of this section. These
instructions are for Ubuntu 7.10 ““Gutsy Gibbon””.



 1.	Back up your computer

 2.	Install Python v. 2.

 a.	Click on ““system”” (upper left of the toolbar) ->
Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager

 b.	Go to ““Settings”” -> ““Repositories”” and make sure
all the boxes are checked under the ““Ubuntu software”” tab

 c.	Enter in your password

 d.	Search for ““Python”” or ““Python2.7”” (searching
just for ““Python”” helps find the most recent packages, and you
can see other useful Python related packages).

 e.	Check the packages ““python”” and ““python2.7”” (or
whatever the latest number is). You might want to add
““python2.7-doc”” and ““python2.7-examples”” too.

 f.	Note, Python is already installed for some Ubuntu installations.

 g.	Create a directory where you will keep your Python programs. One
option is to name it ““src”” and put it in your home folder
(/home/username/src/)

 3.	Install Beautiful Soup. Again, through synaptic, install the package
““python-beautifulsoup““

 4.	Install Komodo Edit, which is a free and open source code editor.
You can download a copy from the Komodo Edit website. Download the Linux
version, double click the file to decompress it, and then read the
installation instructions for Linux.

 5.	Start Komodo Edit. If you don’t see the Toolbox pane on the right
hand side, choose View->Tabs->Toolbox. It doesn’t matter if the
Project pane is open or not. Take some time to familiarize yourself with
the layout of the Komodo editor. The Help file is quite good.

 6.	Configure Komodo Edit. Now you need to set up the editor so that you
can run Python programs

 a.	Choose Toolbox->Add->New Command. This will open a new dialog
window. Rename your command to ““Run Python““. Under
““Command,”” type:



 b.	%(python) %f



 c.	and under ““Start in,”” enter



 d.	%D



 e.	Click OK. Your new Run Python command should appear in the Toolbox
pane
